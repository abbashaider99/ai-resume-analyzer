# AI Integration Testing Guide

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Added Retry Logic**
- AI now retries up to 3 times if the model is loading
- Automatically waits for model to warm up (Hugging Face models sleep when not used)
- Added 2-3 second delays between retries

### 2. **Improved Prompts**
- Using proper `[INST] ... [/INST]` format for Mistral model
- Clearer instructions for JSON output
- Better structured prompts

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Added `wait_for_model: true` parameter
- Handles 503 errors (model loading)
- Handles loading errors in response
- Added detailed console logging

### 4. **Optimized Parameters**
- `return_full_text: false` - Only get generated text, not the prompt
- Lower temperature (0.3-0.4) for more consistent JSON output
- Increased max tokens for complete responses

## How to Test

### Test 1: HireLens Resume Analysis
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/hirelens/upload
2. Upload any PDF resume
3. Fill in job details
4. Click "Analyze Resume"
5. Open browser console (F12)
6. Watch for these logs:
   ```
   Extracting text from resume...
   Extracted text length: XXX characters
   Calling AI with resume text...
   AI API attempt 1/4...
   AI Response received, length: XXX
   ‚úÖ Successfully parsed AI response
   AI Analysis successful!
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- First attempt might show "Model is loading" and retry
- After 3-10 seconds, should get AI response
- Should see "‚úÖ AI Analysis Complete!"

**If Still Fails:**
- Will show "AI unavailable, using local analysis..."
- Uses the fallback data instead
- Resume still gets analyzed with local data

### Test 2: BMI Calculator
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/bmi-calculator
2. Enter: Height 170cm, Weight 70kg, Age 25, Gender Male
3. Click Calculate
4. Check console for AI logs

### Test 3: Website Checker
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/website-checker
2. Enter: google.com
3. Click "Check Website"
4. Wait for analysis
5. Check console for AI logs

## Console Logs to Watch For

### ‚úÖ Success Path:
```
AI API attempt 1/4...
AI generated text length: 1234
AI Response received, length: 1234
First 300 chars: {"overallScore":75,"toneAndStyle"...
‚úÖ Successfully parsed AI response
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Model Loading (Normal):
```
AI API attempt 1/4...
API error (attempt 1): 503 Model is loading
Model is loading, waiting 3 seconds before retry...
AI API attempt 2/4...
[Then should succeed]
```

### ‚ùå Complete Failure:
```
AI API attempt 1/4...
AI API attempt 2/4...
AI API attempt 3/4...
AI API attempt 4/4...
‚ùå AI analysis error: [error message]
[Falls back to local analysis]
```

## Why It Was Failing Before

1. **No Wait for Model**: Hugging Face free tier models go to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. They need 3-5 seconds to "wake up"
2. **No Retries**: Single request would fail if model was loading
3. **Wrong Prompt Format**: Mistral needs `[INST]` tags for best results
4. **Too Few Tokens**: 800 tokens wasn't enough for detailed JSON responses
5. **Temperature Too High**: Higher temperature made JSON output inconsistent

## Current Configuration

### HireLens:
- Max tokens: 1500
- Temperature: 0.3 (more deterministic)
- Retries: 3
- Resume text: 2500 chars max

### BMI Calculator:
- Max tokens: 700
- Temperature: 0.4
- Retries: 2

### Website Checker:
- Max tokens: 600
- Temperature: 0.4
- Retries: 2

## Important Notes

- **First request is slowest**: Model needs to load (5-10 seconds)
- **Subsequent requests are faster**: Model stays warm for ~15 minutes
- **Rate limit**: ~1000 requests/day on free tier
- **Fallback always works**: If AI fails, local analysis still provides results
- **No API key needed**: Completely free, no authentication required

## Troubleshooting

If AI still shows as unavailable:

1. **Check Network**: Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Look for requests to `api-inference.huggingface.co`
2. **Check Console**: Look for specific error messages
3. **Try Different Browser**: Sometimes CORS issues can occur
4. **Wait and Retry**: Model might be heavily loaded, try again in a minute
5. **Fallback Works**: Even if AI fails, you still get analysis results

The key improvement is that the system now **waits for the model to load** instead of immediately failing! üéâ
